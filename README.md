🎓 Credits  
This project is based on the tutorial "Star Rating System in HTML CSS & JavaScript" by "CodingNepal".  
You can check out the original tutorial here: https://youtu.be/rw3eZ6XodN8?si=1KFVtOgLfcCbesDe  

I followed this tutorial to learn HTML & CSS and added my own modifications to improve the design.
